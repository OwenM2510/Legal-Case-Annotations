# Legal-Case-Annotations
Dissertation Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for my dissertation project, which focuses on the data analysis of legal cases. The project explores trends, patterns, and insights in legal data using Python, leveraging its powerful libraries and tools for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

Overview of project:
                  "The purpose of this research project is to analyse and discover patterns within the annotated dataset, produced by the University of Liverpool, which revolves around whether the legal outcomes from these cases from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) where in violation or not according to the facts of the case. From this, a conclusion can be made that if the resulting patterns from these cases can in fact contribute to the training and testing of machine learning tools being developed to decide legal cases fairness."

The project utilizes Python's extensive data science ecosystem, including:
  Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
  NumPy: For numerical computations.
  Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.

Key Features:
  Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, inconsistent formatting, and noisy data to ensure accuracy.
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides insights into trends and correlations.
  Custom Functions: Includes reusable Python functions for various aspects of legal data analysis.

Project sigificance:
  This dissertation served as a foundational step in my journey toward advanced data analytics. Through this project, I:
  Developed a strong understanding of Python's capabilities in data analysis.
  Gained experience in working with real-world, complex datasets.
  Built the confidence to tackle more advanced projects using other languages and tools such as R, SQL, and Tableau.

Future Directions:
  The project is a stepping stone toward more sophisticated data analysis, including:
  Incorporating machine learning techniques for predictive analysis.
  Expanding to multi-language support for broader applicability.
  Exploring visualization tools like Power BI or Tableau for interactive dashboards.
